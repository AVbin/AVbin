Building
--------

AVbin is designed to be used with a particular version of FFmpeg.  This version
of FFmpeg is included in the AVbin project under the ``ffmpeg`` directory.  Note
that this version of FFmpeg may contain avbin-specific patches.  See the file
``ffmpeg/README.avbin`` for more details.

Use the included `build.sh` script to compile AVbin.  This takes care of
configuring FFmpeg correctly, compiling it, then linking it with the AVbin
sources.  The final AVbin libraries are placed in the ``dist`` directory.

To build on your platform, run...

    ./build.sh $TARGET

...where $TARGET is one of:

   linux-x86-32
   linux-x86-64
   darwin-universal
   win32
   win64

Run ``build.sh --help`` for more information.


Caveats
-------

AVbin is currently supported only on the following platforms

* Linux
  - x86 (cross-compiled from x86-64)
  - x86-64
* Mac OS X 10.6 - 10.7
  - x86
  - x86-64
* Windows XP, Vista, 7
  - x86
  - x86-64

The configuration scripts currently assume cross-compilation for Linux-x86-32. 
Minor changes should be needed to to compile on the target platform.  Patches 
for this or other platforms are welcome.

Darwin compilation currently requires OS X 10.6 or greater.

Installation and usage
----------------------

Place the resulting avbin.so, avbin.dylib or avbin.dll from the ``dist``
directory into the appropriate system directory.

The AVbin dynamic library exports all of FFmpeg's functions from libavcodec,
libavutil and libavformat.  It also exports some higher-level functions which
have a fixed ABI (they will not change in incompatible ways in future
releases), documented in ``include/avbin.h``.

License
-------

Due to the linkage between AVbin and FFmpeg, AVbin must be licensed under the
LGPL or GPL.  Currently all GPL features of the FFmpeg configuration are
disabled, permitting LGPL use.

You should see the accompanying COPYING and COPYING.LESSER files for details.
In summary, you must note the usage of FFmpeg and AVbin within the
documentation of your application.  If you make changes to either library, you
must include the sources of these changes within your application.
