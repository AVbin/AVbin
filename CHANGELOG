9   *UNSTABLE RELEASE -- SEE BELOW*
    "Updated" to Libav 0.6.6 -- despite the recentness of the latest release on
        this branch, I believe the svn trunk revision we were using for 8.1
        eventually became the 0.7 branch, which is unfortunately binary
        incompatible because several deprecated functions we use were removed
        in the 0.7 branch.  This release has notable audio glitches under Win64
        in my testing compared to 8.1.  Other than that, I can't determine any
        subjective quality differences from version 8.1.  YMMV.
    Switched back to a universal build for OS X.
    Added libav as a git submodule -- we have our own github libav fork.
    Removed the old ffmpeg svn trunk code.
    build.sh automatically inits and updates the libav module if necessary.
    Fixed Linux build linking under Ubuntu 12.04.
    Updated the config.h patch for 32-bit Linux.
    Removed libavcore.a linking calls - this version doesn't have libavcore.
    Refactored dist.sh:  One main codepath, more error checking, better output.
    Refactored build.sh: Less codepaths, more error checking, better output.
    Updated the copyright on code files.
    Added a README for win64.
