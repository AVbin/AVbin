This copy of libswscale was obtained by running the following commands from the
avbin/ffmpeg directory:

  svn export -r32669 svn://svn.mplayerhq.hu/mplayer/trunk/ trunk
  mv trunk/libswscale .
  rm -rf trunk

This can't be accomplished in one command, because subversion doesn't support
exporting or checking out a directory that does not exist in the most recent 
revision, and the libswscale directory does not exist in the most recent 
revision.
